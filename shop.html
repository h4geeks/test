          <h3>Spherical Glass</h3>
            <p>A "spherical lens" is a lens whose surface has the shape of (part of) the surface of a sphere. With the lens opened wide the image is dominated by light passing through the lens far from the center; consequently, it's the edge rays which you've adjusted the lens to bring to a sharp focus <p>

          <h3>Cylindrical Power Glass</h3>
            <p>Cylinder indicates the amount of lens power for astigmatism. ... The number in the cylinder column may be preceded with a minus sign (for the correction of nearsighted astigmatism) or a plus sign (for farsighted astigmatism). Cylinder power is always written after sphere power.<p>

          <h3>Toric Power Glass</h3>
            <p>The main difference between these toric lenses and regular lenses is the design. Regular lenses have just one power, but toric lenses have two: one for distance vision and one for astigmatism. If you like to wear colored or multifocal lenses lens to bring to a sharp focus<p>
